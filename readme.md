Topic chosen: **Fintech for students**



**About our mission: Website- Wealth Tracker**

In this topic we have decided to make a website to help both students and adults to manage their finances. When you first open the website you have an option between kid or adult. if you choose kid it will take you to a webpage in which you can enter your money earned, money spent, reason for money spent, goals, and in the end it will calculate the amount of money you saved or spent. It will also allow you to mention the amount of money you are saving for your goal every single month and calculate the amount of time until you reach your goal. In the first webpage if you choose adult, then you have to enter your salary, expenditure, reason for money spent, family expenses, and loans. It will calculate your total money spent or saved. For this programmes we have used html, CSS, and JavaScript.
